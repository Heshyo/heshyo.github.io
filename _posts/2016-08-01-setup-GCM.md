title: Setup GCM
---

It took me some times to find again where I can setup Google Cloud Messaging. It's quite confusing as there are several consoles: <https://console.developers.google.com> and <https://console.cloud.google.com>.

So to setup GCM:

- go to <https://console.cloud.google.com>
- select your existing project or create a new one
- on the dashboard you'll see your project ID (you'll want to write it down as you'll need it later)
- click _Go to APIs overview_
- go to _Credentials_
- click _Create credentials_ then select _API key_ and finally click _Server key_
- you'll see your new key, you'll want to copy the _Key_ part and use it with your project ID to send push notifications

Note that you now have [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq/#gcm-fcm) that will probably end up replacing GCM.
