title: Setup GCM
---

It took me some times to find again where I can setup _Google Cloud Messaging_. It's quite confusing as there are several consoles: <https://console.developers.google.com> and <https://console.cloud.google.com>

So to setup GCM:

- go to <https://console.cloud.google.com>
- select your existing project or create a new one (note that as of writing this, even if you created an app in <https://console.developers.google.com> it does not appear in <https://console.cloud.google.com> and you need to create it)
- on the dashboard you'll see your project ID (you'll want to write it down as you'll need it later)
- click _Go to APIs overview_
- go to _Credentials_
- click _Create credentials_ then select _API key_ and finally click _Server key_
- add the address of the server(s) that will send push notifications (note that for test purposes you can use `0.0.0.0/0` to allow anyone, but once your live backend is ready, you'll want to put the real address)
- you'll see your new key, you'll want to copy the _Key_ part and use it with your project ID to send push notifications
- go to the dashboard and enable the _Google Cloud Messaging_ API

Note:

- you now have [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq/#gcm-fcm) that will probably end up replacing GCM.
- now that I try again a few days later, I see the same UI and content on both cloud and developers addresses, just different header. The confusing thing is that by default I end up in the "IAM & Admin" section, and there seems to be no link to get out. Just click on the header (_Google Cloud Platform_ or _Google APIs_) to go back to the dashboard.
