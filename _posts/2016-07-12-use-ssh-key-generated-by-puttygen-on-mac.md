title: Use an SSH key generated by PuTTYgen on a mac
---

I generated an SSH key using [PuTTYgen](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). I chose _Save private key_ and saved it under `%USERPROFILE%/.ssh` as `privKey.ppk`. This is what I use for [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/). I then chose _Conversions_ / _Export OpenSSH key_ and saved it as `id_rsa`. It will be automatically used by some programs, like [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) or [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

I now wanted to `git pull` from the Mac. Here is what I ended up doing

1. Copy the OpenSSH key to `~/.ssh`, I named it `myGitPrivKey`
1. Create a `config` file (or append to it)

```
Host gitServerAlias

	Hostname my.git.server.com
	User myUserName
	Port 12345
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myGitPrivKey
```

Now when I `git pull` I can simply point to `ssh://gitServerAlias/path/to/my/repo.git`.

For more info on the `config` file, run `man ssh_config`.
