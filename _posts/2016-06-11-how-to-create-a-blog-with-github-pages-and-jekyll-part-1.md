How to host your site/blog on GitHub Pages
------------------------------------------

1.	Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one, on [GitHub](https://github.com).
2.	Then create a new GitHub repository named username.github.io, where username is your username
	You can select Jekyll in "Add .gitignore", and whatever license you want (check <http://choosealicense.com/> for an overview of what the main licenses do).
3.	Clone it locally
	In the command line run the following. It'll create a "username.github.io" folder containing you repo
    git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
4.	You can create a simple index.html file, commit it and push it. Then go to <http://username.github.io/> and that's it!
