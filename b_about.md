I like programming because you can create whatever you want, for free (or almost). All you need is a computer (or even a calculator when I was younger) and a logical mind. You can safely experiment with whatever you want.

Nowadays with the Internet and websites like [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/), and tons of creative and talented developers from around the world who share their expertise, it's even easier to get things done (or spend lots of time playing with the latest language or framework).
